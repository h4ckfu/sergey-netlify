    <h1>Swallowed By The Cracks</h1>
    <p>
    The mine provided the town with an economy and employment.  
    The town provided the mine itâ€™s workers.  
    A truly symbiotic relationship stretching back decades; 
    but one that is being ravaged by modernity.
    <p>
    
    <p>
    Global warming, natural gas, and the internet have created giant fissures capable
     of swallowing mining towns whole. </p>
    
    <p>
    When that mining cavity begins to erode, a kind of vertical vent is created 
    through the earth; turbulent air explosively released through the eroded hole,
    as if it were a cosmic geyser spewing trees of debris incessantly over the employee
    parking lot strewn with bodies.
    </p>

    <p>
    Lucky passersby escaping with light injuries while others have to be freed by metal
     jaws, later  to have legs amputated. Still others swallowed whole, intact and unharmed, 
     returning back to the soil.
