        <strong>
        Blues is often the subject of mediation where the mind focuses only on the mantra of the blues.
        </strong>

    <p>
        <i>It doesn't make sense, it just is.</i> Transcendental Blues is different from other forms
        of the blues - tailoring methods, chords and scales to your individual needs following
        more or less a 12 bar vibe.
    </p>

    <p>
        Practicing the blues helps you relax and focus on the most important things in life
        without quickly tiring the brain. Therefore, Blues is the main path of general
        body inhibition and relaxation with sacred meaning free from a religious movement.
    </p>

    <p> 
        However, all Blues with or without meaning are classically understood as 
        the devils meditations. In other words, these are meditations that create a sense of
        humanity focused world. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Before you begin, ask yourself are the blues in you and do they got to come out?
    </p>

    <p>
        Some believe that the use of Blues heals in a positive and balanced way. Blues meditation is a form of 
        anti mindfulness practice in which you got to get down.
    </p>

    <p>
        <blockquote><code>The subject of the Blues and it's related practices is a comprehensive 
        study of "It's Bad You Know"</code> 
        </blockquote> 
    </p>

    <p>
        Depending on the tradition, the blues master has practiced many different Blues,
        knows the type of vibration of each person and can choose one for you based on your
        karma.
    </p>

    <p>
        Learn the Blues used on this particular path, try them for a few years, and 
        then choose to simultaneously consider the meaning represented by 
        your current situation. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly Remember that Blues are the truth; used to excite the mind and 
        bring back memories or feelings, as affirmations do.
