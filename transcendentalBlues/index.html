    <p>
        Blues are often the subject of mediation where the mind focuses only on the mantra of the blues.
It doesn't make sense, it just is. Transcendental Blues is different from other forms
of the blues - tailoring methods and Blues to your individual needs and needs,
transcendental blues follows more or less a 12 bar vibe.
    </p>

<p>
    Practicing the blues helps you relax and focus on the most important things 
without quickly tiring the brain. Therefore, Blues are the main path of general
body inhibition and relaxation with sacred meaning free from a religious movement.
</p>

<p> 
        However, all Blues with or without meaning are classically understood as 
        the devils meditations. In other words, these are meditations that create a sense of
        humanity focused world. 
</p>

 
<p>
    Before you begin, ask yourself are the blues in you and do they got to come out?
</p>

<p>Some believe that the use of Blues during meditation practice helps them to relax
        in a positive and balanced way. In this case, blues meditation is a form of 
        anti mindfulness practice in which you got to get down.</p>

<blockquote><code>The subject of the Blues and it's related practices is a comprehensive 
        study of "It's Bad You Know"</code> </blockquote> 


<p>
        Depending on the tradition, the blues master has practiced very different Blues,
        knows the type of vibration of each person and can choose one for you based on his
        karma.
</p>

<p>
        Learn the Blues used on this particular path, try them for a few days, and 
        then choose to simultaneously consider the meaning or state represented by 
        your current situation. 
</p>


<p>
        Lastly Remember that Blues are the truth; used to excite the mind and 
        bring back memories or feelings, as affirmations do.
