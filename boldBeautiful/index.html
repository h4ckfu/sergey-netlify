        Meanwhile...  Rick was laid up after falling off a roof, following a fight...
        Eventually peace was restored until Bill Spencer came to town.

        <h4>Eric:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a fashion house called Forrester Creations</li>
            <li>Had an affair with Brooke Logan ( who was in love with Ridge )</li>
            <li>Married a nanny nurse </li>
            <li>Asked Stephanie to become part of his life again?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p> 
     Brooke is sent back in time to when Eric is still a vampire.  
     Eric is under the anciet spell of Stephanie. </p>

    <p>
        His hopes are dashed when Stephanie tells him know that they are 
        just portraying characters on a show, and that she loves Rick and 
        is committed to him and his relationship with Victoria 
    </p>

    <p>
        Eric says: "Under the energy of the Full Moon, I see what extremes
         Stephanie goes to get what she wants, I swears revenge "
    </p>

    <p>
        <blockquote><code>To be shot at the end of Forrester Creations Fashion show
            or drowning after Stephanie walked away....</code> 
        </blockquote> 
    </p>

    <p>
        Later, Brooke and Rafael create a more intimate episode and 
        Wyatt falls in love with Liam and kisses him.  Steffy goes to Washington 
        to work with the CIA to find the other girls in the program.
        However, she returns with some news for Heather that will change everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Logan's recently meddled in on the vampire's relationships and they 
        are unabashed about it.  Brooke confront her about her misdeeds, 
        and throws all of vampire's previous crimes in their faces.  
    </p>

    <p>
        When the clock on the wall reached its peak, Brooke suddenly sensed
         the sharp knifes piercing sensation exactly as she had 100 years ago.
