     I specifically remember when I knew that public education was bullshit. 
     It's Nathaniel Hawthorne's fault...
    <p>
    
    <p>
    I never thrived in the public education system of the eighties but I quit 
    trying all together when I was forced to read “The House of the Seven Gables” 
    and told it was <i>a classic</i> and <i>great literature</i>.

    While some of my classmates had never read a book outside of school, I had already read extensively by this point.  
    For at least a few years books were my drug of choice.

    I would dodge my cretinous contemporaries and their ridiculous posing and primping by grabbing a good book and spending lunch reading wherever I was least likely to be found.

   While I didn’t always do everything I was assigned in School nobody ever had to force me to read, especially a “classic”.   Sure I’d read about Holden Caulfield; but I had also devoured A Brave New World, Animal Farm, and even Beyond Good and evil by the time I was force fed this drivel.
